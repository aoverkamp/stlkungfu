    <h2>School of Southern Praying Mantis</h2>
    <h3>Always fighting forward</h3>
    <p class="lead">Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu is a traditional infighting system that helps everyday people strengthen the body, calm the mind and protect themselves from harm.</p>
    <p>My name is Pete Scheers and I lead the St. Louis Branch School of the Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu Academy.</p>
    <p>We continue the teachings of the late Grandmaster Henry Yee, who immigrated from China in 1955 and founded the Chinese Kung Fu Academy (CKFA) of Southern Praying Mantis Federation U.S.A. in 1982.</p>
    <p>Learn more about our system, classes and kung fu community to see if this is the right school for you.</p>

            <h2>Our System</h2>
            <p>A praying mantis doesn’t dance. It hits hard and ends fights fast. Our infighting system provides maximum power with minimum movement. We get in close, utilizing core strength and momentum control to strike quickly and powerfully. Don’t expect high kicks or backflips. Southern Praying Mantis is a practical self-defense system for adults of all ages.</p>
