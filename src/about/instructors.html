            <h2>Kristen Hood</h2>
            <p>Kristen started her training at STL Kung Fu in 2014 as a high schooler. During the early years of training Kristen attended class with her dad & sister as a family bonding activity. However, Kristen quickly found a greater appreciation for the Southern Praying Mantis fighting style and earned the nickname “coach” for her ability to remember the forms & assist SiFu Pete in his teachings.</p>
            <p>When not practicing Kung Fu, she works as a mental health therapist with a degree in Social Work. Kristen is eager to teach beginners and offer training opportunities to those who prefer a female instructor.</p>
            <p>Coach is responsible for the kids program. We like to group ages 5-8 and 9-12 in separate classes. Class size is limited to 6 students and is based on current interest. We will look to add Kids Kung Fu classes in September. </p>

            <h2>Anthony Overkamp</h2>
            <p>Anthony has been passionate about martial arts since the age of 10, beginning a lifelong journey that encompasses a variety of disciplines. From ages 13 to 18, he trained in boxing, kickboxing, and karate while balancing the demands of high school ice hockey. This diverse background laid the foundation for his understanding of movement, discipline, and athleticism.</p>
            <p>After high school, Anthony explored the meditative and holistic aspects of martial arts through tai chi, practicing from ages 18 to 25. In winter 2008, he began training in Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu under his Sifu Pete Scheers, marking a significant milestone in his martial arts journey. Since then, Anthony has focused on becoming proficient enough to help others in their training. He leads kung fu sessions every Tuesday night and Sunday morning, creating a welcoming environment for students to drill, learn, and workout together.</p>
            <p>In addition to his martial arts pursuits, Anthony holds a Master of Fine Arts in Painting from Fontbonne University and serves as the Creative Director at Engage, a software company in St. Louis. Outside of work and martial arts, he enjoys traveling with his wife, Carrie, and capturing moments through photography, drawing, and painting.</p>
