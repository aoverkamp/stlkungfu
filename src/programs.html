			<p class="lead">We provide the following classes. I do not require contracts. We agree to pay within the first week of the month to get one month of training. This way, if you decide this Kung Fu is not for you, you are not tied into a yearly contract.</p>
			<p><strong>Please call about prices</strong>. Discount given to security personnel and law enforcement. Other arrangements can be made; for example decrease from an hour, less frequent training times, etc. Please leave a quick voicemail if no answer. I will call back the same day (or even within a few hours).</p>

<!-- Program Details -->
<section class="details details__programs">
	<div class="callout" style="min-height: auto;">
		<h2>Private</h2>
		<div class="row row__60-40">
			<div class="col">
				<p style="text-align: left;">Limited to 1-2 students (or more if a family is training). Private lessons allow me to focus solely on you and what you need to develop to learn this Kung Fu. Each class we will review what we did the week before, review corrections, learn a new drill, and do two-man exercise(s). I tailor my teaching to what the students want to learn or to what they want to get out of the Kung Fu (for some folks it’s self-defense, some want to build up strength, some just want to learn Kung Fu). Most of the classes are private lessons. Over the years I’ve learned that this is a more efficient use of my and the students’ time.</p>

		<h2>Chi Kung</h2>
		<div class="row row__60-40">
			<div class="col">
				<p style="text-align: left;">Chi Kung means breath work. Use your breath coordinated with movement to increase your health. Chi Kung is known to regulate blood pressure, increase oxygen flow in the body, regulate asthma, and slow down the aging process. This program is for people who have little to no experience with Chi Kung. Class will cover standing and sitting meditations, small and large circle breathing, basic motions, and the philosophy behind Chi Kung.</p>
